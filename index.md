Here youâ€™ll find a mix of stories, reflections, and insights drawn from my winding journey â€” from growing up as the oldest of six in Alabama to navigating the fast-paced world of product management and gig economy platforms.

Iâ€™m endlessly curious about how people work, learn, and connect, and I love digging into the intersections of technology, community, and personal growth. Youâ€™ll find posts about product strategy, leadership, creative side projects, and maybe a few nerdy deep dives into philosophy or music along the way.

I believe in showing up authentically, embracing change, and helping others grow â€” and I hope this space can be a resource and a spark for anyone looking to do the same.
