    Here you’ll find a mix of stories, reflections, and insights drawn from my winding journey — from growing up as the oldest of six in Alabama to navigating the fast-paced world of product management.<br><br>
    I’m endlessly curious about how people work, learn, and connect, and I love digging into the intersections of technology, community, and personal growth. You’ll find posts about product strategy, leadership, and more.<br><br>
    I believe in showing up authentically, embracing change, and helping others grow — and I hope this space can be a resource and a spark for anyone looking to do the same.
