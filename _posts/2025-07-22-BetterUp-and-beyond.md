## We can start with values

I recently completed BetterUp coaching through my job at Shipt, right as I was stepping into the role I had been pursuing for the past 4 years. I came to our first session armed with all the things that I wanted to work on. I had a list, a plan, and a mindset.
<br><br>
### 🔬 My Focus
   1. Strategic thinking skills 🧠
   2. Professional Brand ™️
   3. Values, strengths, and leadership style 💪
<br><br>

But my coach, [Louise Neil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-neil), saw something I didn’t. She suggested we start not with tactics, but with values. That small shift changed everything.

We used a resource¹ to help surface my core values and begin shaping an identity statement, but it wasn’t the tool that made the difference. It was the space she created, the questions she asked, and the way she invited me to reflect.
<br><br><br>
One line from that session stuck with me: <i>"Don't should yourself.</i>
<br><br><br>
Choose the values that <i>truly</i> resonate. Not because they should, but because they do.

The rest of our time together became all about learning to communicate the why behind the values that I had chosen. We worked on the narrative for these words, giving each individual word personal meaning and grounding them in my story.
<br><br><br>
I am so thankful for Louise recognizing me when she saw me, and challenging what I brought to the table. I came with a list of priorities that I should have, and she guided me to flip them directly on their head. 

This reversal revealed a deep truth: <b> growth starts with identity, not tactics. </b>
