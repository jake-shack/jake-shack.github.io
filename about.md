I’m Jake Shackelford, a Senior Product Manager at Shipt with deep experience in gig economy platforms, multi-sided marketplaces, and shopper experience design. I bring a background in data analytics, technical strategy, and user-centered product development, and I thrive at the intersection of systems thinking and storytelling.

Outside of work, I’m always learning—whether it’s building creative tools, mentoring aspiring PMs, or exploring new ways to integrate values like authenticity, growth, and community into my leadership style.

I’m passionate about using technology and insight to create smarter, more empathetic experiences—and I’m always open to opportunities to collaborate or contribute meaningfully.
